# themefurmanu

The `themefurmanu` package provides a custom `ggplot2` theme and font registration functions using Furman Universityâ€™s visual identity.

Note that this is not an official package from Furman University. It is a personal project to help with visual consistency in data visualizations across teams at Furman that use `R`.

## Installation

```r
# From GitHub
devtools::install_github("scottamoore/themefurmanu")
```

## Usage

```r
library(themefurmanu)

# Font registration is automatic, but you can also do it explicitly:
# register_furmanu_fonts()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency by Car Weight",
    subtitle = "Using Furman theme and fonts",
    caption = "Source: mtcars dataset"
  ) +
  theme_furmanu()
```
